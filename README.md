# MVVM-Based E-Commerce Mobile App for Eyewear with Virtual Try-On

This mobile application, following the MVVM architecture, provides an Android front-end for an e-commerce store specializing in the sale of prescription and non-prescription eyewear. Initially intended to use Prestashop for backend management, the project shifted to a custom-built solution due to challenges with the Prestashop API.

The app includes a virtual try-on feature for glasses, leveraging Google's Mediapipe API to provide a augmented reality experience. While the virtual try-on is still in development, there's potential to enhance it by integrating Google's Filament rendering engine for improved visual realism.

Overall, this application serves as a proof of concept, exploring innovative approaches to digital eyewear retail.
